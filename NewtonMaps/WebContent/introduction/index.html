<p>The solar system is composed of several bodies in motion subject
				to mutually attracting forces. These forces are strong enough to
				avoid the objects from escaping from the system. Since the
				surrounding space is almost perfectly empty there is no friction nor
				other significant motion-destructive force, so the objects keep
				endlessly moving. The planets, for example, are turning around the
				sun since some billion years.
			</p>
<p>Actually, the only thing that could stop moving an object is a
				collision with another object. But the solar system bodies are so
				small in front of its surrounding space that a collision becomes
				really improbable. Even the sun, the biggest object in the system,
				is insignificant compared to its distance to Mercury, the nearest
				planet.

<p>The paths of these objects in the solar system are called orbits.
				The most obvious cases are the planets. In a first approach, they
				turn around the sun in elliptical orbits. They do the complete turn
				in a finite time (~365.25 days in the case of the Earth) after what
				they begin again, starting from the same point, with the same
				velocity, by the same path. Other bodies have similar orbits.
				Asteroids and some comets have also elliptical orbits around the
				sun.
			</p>
<p>Moons have more complicated orbits since they
				turn around the planets. In fact, from the point of view of the
				solar system satellite orbits are not closed. They do spirals
				twisting around planet orbits.
			</p>
<p>One can say that everything that lays in the solar system moves in
				an orbit. Even the sun, who lays almost static, pulled by the
				planets, moves slightly, and its path is an orbit too.

				Even spacecrafts move often on orbits. Beside the maneuver
				operations, spacecrafts spend the most part of the time with the
				engines switched off, saving fuel and taking advantage of its own
				inertia. During these periods of inactivity, the spacecraft moves
				exactly as a pebble would do. So, in general, spacecraft moves on
				segments of orbit with short periods of transition where the engines
				are running. These periods of maneuver operations are called
				orbit transitions
				because they allow the spacecraft to move from an orbit to another
				one.

<p>One can study the set of all possible orbits in the solar system.
				The objective of this site is to show some special orbits. A kind of
				orbits similar to the orbits used to travel in the solar system. The
				difference from real interplanetary missions is optimality. Real
				spacecraft orbits are chosen carefully to get the best results in
				terms of cost, time, risk and other criteria. The orbits shown in
				this site are not optimal but they illustrate some interesting
				properties
